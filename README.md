# My bucket list

## Overview

Hello, this is my bucket list of the places I would like to visit. React would be used as the front-end application while Sinatra would be used as my back-end database. This API would be used to demostrate my knowledge on what I have learned from Flatiron. I would be using a one to many relationship on two models: attractions and restaurants. The two models will belong to my Locations model.

## Feature List

- Home Page

- Create Location (post)

- Create attraction (post)

- Create restaurant (post)

- List location, attraction and restaurant option(s)

- Delete location, attraction and restaurant (delete)

- Show 1 specific location (via search bar)

 
## MVP

1. List locations 

2. Create locations route

3. Delete locations 

4. List a single location

5. Connect the one to many relationship between the models 

6. List attraction(s)

7. List restaurant(s)


### Stretch Goals

8. Update location name

9. Update attraction(s)

10. Update restaurant(s) 


### Backend Start up

To start the server, run: 

```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).
