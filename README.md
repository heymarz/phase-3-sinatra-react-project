# My bucket list

## OverView

Hello, this is my bucket list of the places I would like to visit. React would be used as the front-end application while Sinatra would be used as my back-end database. This API would be used to demostrate my knowledge on what I have learned from flat iron. I would be using a one to many relationship on two models: attractions and places to dine. 

## Feature List

- Home Page
- Create Location (post)
- Create attraction (post)
- Create dining (post)
- List location, attraction and dining option(s)
- update location, attraction or dining option(s) (update)
- Delete location, attraction or dining (delete)
- show 1 specific location (get(location))
 
## MVP

1. List locations (sinatra)
2. Create locations route (sinatra)
3. Delete locations (sinatra)
4. Home Page (react)
5. List locations (react)
6. Delete locations (react)
6. Create locations (react)

7. Update attractions with a patch (sinatra)
8. List attraction (sinatra)
9. Delete attraction (sinatra)
10. Create attraction (react)
11. List attraction (react)
12. Delete attraction (react)

13. Create Dining (sinatra)
14. List dining (sinatra)
15. Delete dinning (sinatra)
16. Create dining (react)
17. List dining (react)
18. Delete dining (react) 

### Stretch Goals

19. Updating location (patch)
20. Updating attractions (patch)
21. Updating dining options (patch)
22. Show one specific location (get)

### Backend Start up

To start the server, run: 
```console
$ bundle exec rake server
```

This will run your server on port
[http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).


### Frontend Start up

The front end is in another folder called phase-3-bucket-list-frontend,
to start, run:

```console
$ npm start ```

You can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
