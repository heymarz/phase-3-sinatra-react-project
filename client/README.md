# My bucket List with React App

## Overview

This is my front end of a bucket list of the places I would like to visit. This API would be used to demostrate my knowledge on what I have learned from Flatiron using React as my front-end and Sinatra as my back-end(server).

## Feature List

- Home Page

- Search bar

- Travel form to add a new location with restaurant(s) and attraction(s)


## MVP

1. Home Page 

2. List all locations

3. Delete a location along with its attached attraction(s) and/or restaurant(s)

4. Create location along with attraction(s) and/or restaurant(s)

5. Search for a location based on state name


## Stretch Goals

- update location, attraction or restaurant option(s) (update)


## Frontend Start up

The front end is in another folder called client,
to start, run the following code in your terminal:

```
$ cd client
$ yarn start 
```

You can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
